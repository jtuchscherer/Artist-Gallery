<p class="title">The Mad Hatter's Tea Party 2004</p>
<p>Was made as a response to the political climate and, being a
British citizen and unable to vote in the 2004 elections, I decided to
create the characters of the Mad Hatter's Tea Party. This was the
largest and most thematically organized piece I had created. While I
controlled the creative aspect, I was joined by a dozen volunteers in
the creation of "The Party"</p>
<p>The heads of the characters are a result of a couple of years of
development of my own method of sculpting with brown paper tape. I
developed this method of sculpting as an answer to a sculptor's
challenges of ease, flexibility, durability, weight, and of course,
cost. I have found it a material that is simple to construct, finish,
and carry, thus it was an obvious choice for the creation of these
characters.</p>
<p>Each head required between 40 & 60 hours to complete and were all
sculpted over a three month period. As a base I used foam core, aluminum
wire, newspaper, and PVC pipe. The paper tape was then applied in
layers, molded, dried and finally painted. They were then mounted, along
with the PVC-framed costumes on backpacks. The Mad Hatter's Tea Party
has been paraded in three states for thousands of people in both
organized and "guerilla art" outings.</p>
<p>The project would not have possible with out the help of may
people.</p>
<p>Firstly when I proposed the project to a friend, he not only
encouraged me but a package of art supplies arrived in the mail. So
first I must thank Kevin Hanlon.<br />
Then I would like to thank Allen Mueller for his help and vision with
the project his political knowledge and helping me come up with the
characters. Allen designed and constructed the molds for the tea cups.
Then with many volunteers and yards and yards of packing tape we made up
the Tea cups.<br />
Next many thanks to the following people:
<ul>
	<li>Rudiger Schmidt for help designing and working on back packs
	being the best critic an artist could wish for, and for being the first
	to wear the White Rabbit.</li>
	<li>Bob Buckley and Chris Kendal for moral support and for writing
	the Homeland security song, and being the characters being the masks.</li>
	<li>Beth Brotherton for many things especially with the White
	Rabbit.</li>
	<li>Carol Jenkins for help with painting</li>
	<li>David Mans</li>
	<li>Gay Paxton</li>
	<li>Tom Balzer</li>
	<li>Greta Balzer</li>
	<li>Jonathan Bartsch</li>
	<li>Joy Boston</li>
	<li>Dedra Smith</li>
	<li>Oak Chezar</li>
	<li>Jyoti Sharp</li>
	<li>Rick and Kael Davis</li>
</ul>

<p class="title">"Packages" by Colorado artist, Emma Hardy</p>
<p>The piece will be made nearly entirely of paper and wood and is a
community of life-sized characters representing a sample of our society.
At the center there is a tree trunk around which the figures will orbit,
providing a point of reflection and self realization. Each figure will
have a unique audible heartbeat and the viewer will be able to add their
own heartbeat to the soundtrack, providing the experience of a
collective "consciousness". An additional component will be brown paper
packages or parcels in which the viewer will observe ethereal scenes,
evoking the abstract nature of our individual thoughts. "Packages" is
meant to evoke our sense of isolation and individuality. We can only
really know someone through their appearance and what they themselves
choose to present to the world.</p>
